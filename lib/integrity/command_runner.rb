    # The idea is shamelessly stolen from Bundler.
    #
    # In general, Bundler sets several environment variables to operate,
    # the issue is that parent shell propogate its evironment to
    # subshells, which breaks builds, because your build is
    # trying to use Integrity's gemfile.
    #
    # So here we unset some of that environment variables to let
    # build's bundler create its own environment.
    #
    # When build is done we rollback to previous environment.
    #
    # Bundler team will probably create a way to avoid this, but
    # most likely it won't be sooner than Bundler 1.1
    #
    # FIXME:
    # If you're using RVM gemsets and runnig Integrity in RVM shell,
    # make sure that Bundler gem is installed into current gemset,
    # not global. Otherwise, Bundler will drop path to your global
    # gemset.
